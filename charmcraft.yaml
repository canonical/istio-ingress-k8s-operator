  Istio Ingress is a Juju charm for managing Istio ingress gateways in Kubernetes clusters.
  It automates deployment and configuration, providing secure and reliable traffic routing.

    - name: ubuntu
      channel: "22.04"
      architectures: ["amd64"]

      # TODO after https://github.com/canonical/istio-ingress-k8s-operator/issues/7 closed: 
      #      remove rpds-py from this list
      - "rpds-py"

config:
  options:
    ready-timeout:
      type: int
      default: 100
      description: >
        The maximum time (in seconds) to wait for the gateway deployment to be 
        ready. This applies specifically to the deployment/LB created for the Istio 
        gateway controller. If the deployment does not become ready within this time, 
        charm will go into blocked state.
    external_hostname:
      description: |
        The DNS name to be used by Istio ingress.
        If unspecified, the gateway ingress ip address will be used, e.g,
        as provided by MetalLB. This needs to be a `bare` hostname: i.e. 
        no schema prefix and no port.
        Hostname can be “precise” which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. “foo.example.com”).
        It's also important to note that domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. *.example.com) isn't supported for now.
