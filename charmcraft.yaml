title: Istio Ingress
summary: A Juju charm to deploy and manage ingresses
description: |
  Istio Ingress is a Juju charm for managing Istio ingress gateways in Kubernetes clusters.
  It automates deployment and configuration, providing secure and reliable traffic routing.
assumes:
  - k8s-api
  - juju >= 3.6

  ubuntu@24.04:amd64:

config:
  options:
    ready-timeout:
      type: int
      default: 100
      description: >
        The maximum time (in seconds) to wait for the gateway deployment to be 
        ready. This applies specifically to the deployment/LB created for the Istio 
        gateway controller. If the deployment does not become ready within this time, 
        charm will go into blocked state.
    external_hostname:
      description: |
        The DNS name to be used by Istio ingress.
        If unspecified, the gateway ingress ip address will be used, e.g,
        as provided by MetalLB. This needs to be a `bare` hostname: i.e. 
        no schema prefix and no port.
        Hostname can be “precise” which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. “foo.example.com”).
        It's also important to note that domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. *.example.com) isn't supported for now.

provides:
  ingress:
    interface: ingress
    description: |
      Provides ingress-like routing to the related Juju application, load-balancing across all units.  If the ingress
      has authentication configured, all paths will have authentication applied to them.  Otherwise, the paths will be
      unauthenticated.  
      Note that if more than one application related to either `ingress` or `ingress-unauthenticated` asks for an 
      ingress of the same path, no route is created and the charm will go into a blocked state.
  ingress-unauthenticated:
    interface: ingress
    description: |
      Provides ingress-like routing to the related Juju application, similar to the `ingress` relation.  Unlike
      the `ingress` relation, paths ingressed here will never have authentication applied to them, even if the ingress
      has authentication configured.
      Note that if more than one application related to either `ingress` or `ingress-unauthenticated` asks for an 
      ingress of the same path, no route is created and the charm will go into a blocked state.
  metrics-endpoint:
    interface: prometheus_scrape
  istio-ingress-config:
    interface: istio_ingress_config
    limit: 1
    description: |
      Provides an interface for exchanging Istio ingress configuration,
      including external authorizer configuration details.
  istio-ingress-route:
    interface: istio_ingress_route
    description: |
      Provides advanced ingress routing with support for multiple ports and protocols
      (HTTP, gRPC) using typed configuration models. Requirers can define custom
      Gateway listeners and routes. If the ingress has authentication configured,
      all routes will have authentication applied to them.
  istio-ingress-route-unauthenticated:
    interface: istio_ingress_route
    description: |
      Provides advanced ingress routing similar to istio-ingress-route, but routes
      will never have authentication applied to them, even if the ingress has
      authentication configured.
  gateway-metadata:
    interface: gateway_metadata
    description: |
      Provides metadata about the Gateway workload including namespace, gateway name,
      deployment name, and service account. This allows related charms to reference
      the Gateway workload in their configurations (e.g., in AuthorizationPolicies).

requires:
  certificates:
    interface: tls-certificates
    limit: 1
    description: |
      Send a CSR to- and obtain a signed certificate from an external CA.
  charm-tracing:
    interface: tracing
    limit: 1
    description: |
      Enables sending charm traces to a distributed tracing backend such as Tempo.
  forward-auth:
    interface: forward_auth
    limit: 1
